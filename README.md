Hello!

This repo hosts the code for my NBA Stats website project. The goal for this is to be able to show stats in both table and graph form, and to allow a lot of customization by the user so that they can view what they want. I'm currently working on getting the tables and a basic graph to show, and after that I'll be working on improving the CSS and adding more features. I'm currently testing from a live server in VSCode, I originally tried GitHub Pages but it can't import libraries, at least not easily.

Current Roadmap:
1. Finish Table: I've figured out the code for the table, but need to do more research on how to restrict it to a certain size so that it doesn't fill up the page. Probably something with css + adding a scrollbar will fix this. 
2. Graphs: I first want to show a basic graph using a libary I found, and will eventually expand on it so that graph axes and types can be changed by the user.
3. CSS: The current site doesn't look great, so I want to improve the CSS so it looks better than the basic stuff I've done so far. I'm waiting to do this for now so I know what the content on the site will be.
